# ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks -- Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey Hinton

Presented by [Puneeth Chaganti](http://twitter.com/punchagan)

## Notes from the meetup

The meetup was attended by 7 people.  Puneeth gave an introduction to Neural
Networks and Deep Neural networks, and gave a brief overview of the AlexNet
paper. The paper was advanced and quite hard to understand for people with no
background.  But, it did trigger some interesting discussion, and kindled some
interest in this area.
