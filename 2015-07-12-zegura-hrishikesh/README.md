Presented by [Hrishikesh Barua](https://twitter.com/talonx)

## Notes from the meetup

The meetup was attended by 4 people.  Hrishikesh gave an introduction to SDN
and discussed the evolution of SDN as detailed in the paper.  The talk started
from bottom up and was very well structured, building up on simple concepts to
make the concepts of SDN accessible to beginners.  The talk ended with a demo
of a simple SDN controller using Pox and mininet.
