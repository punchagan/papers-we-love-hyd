==================

This is a repository for discussions around a Hyderabad chapter of Papers We Love. 

The group is just starting off, and to participate in the discussion for booting-up, see [Issue #1](https://github.com/punchagan/papers-we-love-hyd/issues/1).

## Papers We Love

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.

Papers We Love is a [repository](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) of academic computer science papers and a [community](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/wiki/Creating-a-PWL-chapter) who loves reading them.

## Meetup format

The meetup begins with a presentation on a paper, that was chosen for that meetup.

After the speaker presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion and questions.  

We hope that you'll read the paper before the meetup, but don't stress if you can't.  If you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, feel free to leave comments on the GitHub issue.
