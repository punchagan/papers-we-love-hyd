# Papers We Love, Hyderabad

An archive of resources from the Papers We Love meet-ups in Hyderabad.

## Papers We Love

A community that loves sharing, reading and discussing academic computer
science papers.

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What
did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome
academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and
paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements
these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD
MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.

Papers We Love is a
[repository](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) of academic
computer science papers and a
[community](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/wiki/Creating-a-PWL-chapter)
who loves reading them.

## Meetup format

The meetup begins with a presentation on a paper, that was chosen for that
meetup.

After the speaker presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion
and questions.

We hope that you'll read the paper before the meetup, but don't stress if you
can't.  If you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, feel free
to leave comments on the GitHub issue.

## Interacting with other members

We use a [Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-hyderabad/) to
coordinate activities for the group, while this repository serves as an
archive for the material presented and discussed during these meet-ups.

You can participate in the discussions for the group on the
[group's mailing list](http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-hyderabad/messages/archive/)
or share your suggestion/feedback by creating
[a new issue](https://github.com/punchagan/papers-we-love-hyd/issues/new) or
commenting on an existing
[issue](https://github.com/punchagan/papers-we-love-hyd/issues).

Please be good to each other and to the PWL community!  Here's our
